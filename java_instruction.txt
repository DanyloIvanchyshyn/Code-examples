User Manual:

1. Log in to the console (enter one of the names: Leontovych or Lysenko and password qwerty5678).

2. Select one of four possible actions by entering a number from 1 to 4 in the console.

3. For the "Kick out a student" action, enter the number of the student you want to expel.

4. For the "Choose a class monitor" action, enter the minimum characteristics that the headman must possess.
   For example, for the query "Class monitors honesty must be at least" we enter 4. This will mean that the student will be selected from students with experience greater than 4 units (units).
   Similarly for "honesty" and "leadskills" queries. For "laziness" we enter 6, which means that the laziness of old age should be less than 6 ppm.
   Note: If several students are applying for the seniority position, the program proposes to move on to the second round and re-enter the criteria for selection of seniority. The main thing is not to overdo it)
